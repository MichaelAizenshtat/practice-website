# Practice Website
A project I built to get started with web development.

## What I Made
A copy of a website that was made using Bootstrap, but without using Bootstrap.

## Where You Can Find It
[https://michaelaizenshtat.github.io/practice-website/]

## What I learned
- HTML Basics
  - tags
  - classes/id's
  - semantic HTML
- CSS 
  - selectors(simple,combinator,pseudo)
  - Flex Box
  - transitions
  - variables
  - Media Queries
- Javascript
  - basics(loops, functions...)
  - DOM manipulation using events
- Git
  - creating local repositories
  - making commits
  - creating branches
  - pushing to host repository
  

## What Problems I Had
One of the biggest problems I ran into was adding responsivity to the page. Media Queries presented
a challenged. After some time I added basic responsivity, however there are still some errors that need
to be addresses. 

## What I Plan To Do Next
I plan to gain more experience with responsive design, most likely by following some video tutorials
and working on creating some webpages using a mobile-first approach to get more experience with media queries.
I may return and revise this project at a later date to add better responsivity.
